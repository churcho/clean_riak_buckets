# Clean Riak DB

This small modul written in erlang, allows to delete all buckets in a riak database. This modul is only recomended to be used while developing and should not be used on any db which is in production mode. Since this modul will delete all key and values in all existing buckets. 

THIS MODEL WILL DELETE ALL DATA IN YOUR DB! Be carefull and don't blame me for any data loss you may will have. So keep in mind:

	with great power comes great responsibility

# Dependings

Bashos erlang riak client will be needed to get this running. So go and download and build it, if you don't already have.

# Todo

Bring this module in a better structure (OTP Style) to make it more convenient, so it can be used with bashos rebar.
